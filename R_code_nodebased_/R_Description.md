For R users. Scripts to run big data FVCOM outputs locally. Includes visualization, analysis, and animations of spatiotemporal data. The current spatial framework here is node based, so.., while 3-D explicit spatially and temporally resolved, it is not volumetric. So include traingular elements & etc. in the variable extraction section in "big_cluster_sim.." to do this or use the python code.
